# Gradebook_Hash-Table
  This project consists of hash tables which are chained by a singly linked list. Users have a couple of options when running the .exe file. These options consist of: creating a file for a user to send information such as student ID and grades, insert grades for a student ID number, search a students grade with their student ID, delete a students grade with their student ID, and to exit the program.
  
  There are still some bugs with the program. When a grade is inserted into a student ID, then deleted. If a user were to search a students grade with the same ID that got deleted, the program crashes and terminates.
