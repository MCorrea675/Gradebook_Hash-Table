# Gradebook_Hash-Table
  This project consists of hash tables which are chained by a singly linked list. Users have a couple of options when running the .exe file. These options consist of: creating a file for a user to send information such as student ID and grades, insert grades for a student ID number, search a students grade with their student ID, delete a students grade with their student ID, and to exit the program.
